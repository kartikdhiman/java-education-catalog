# Foojay Java in Education Catalog Site Specification

The Foojay Java in Education Catalog is a community-driven catalog of Java learning resources for students, educators, coding clubs, and developers. This repository is hosted under [Foojay.io – Friends of OpenJDK](https://github.com/foojayio/java-education-catalog) and maintained by the Java community.

## Site Structure

- Single `index.html` file (HTML + inline CSS, no build step)
- Dark theme with card-based layout
- Sticky nav, hero section, then content sections separated by dividers
- Responsive: cards collapse to single column on mobile
- Preserve the ordering in this spec

## Visual Design

- Integrate the Foojay logo `foojay-logo.png` in the hero section with maximum width and height of 150px, maintaining aspect ratio. Place it to the left of the title on desktop, and above the title on mobile.
- Hero section: make subtitle bigger then description
- Dark background (`#00131B`), card surfaces (`#132733`), accent blue (`#3562E5`), accent cyan (`#4FC3F7`), accent green (`#5EB761`), accent orange (`#F0981B`)
- Cards have hover effects (border highlight, slight lift)
- Badge types: `badge-framework` (blue), `badge-inference` (cyan), `badge-assistant` (orange), `badge-resource` (green)
- Where possible use icons for links - for blog or other use a world / www icon. don't use text labels.
- In a given section, use different colors for different badge types.

### Link Affordance

- **Clickable cards:** If a card has a single primary destination (e.g. resource cards with one link), make the entire card an `<a>` tag so clicking anywhere on the card navigates. Keep secondary icon links overlaid on top.
- **Card titles as links:** For cards with multiple links (frameworks, tools), make the card `h3` title a clickable link to the primary resource. For all the links, add an icon + plus the link text. Style title links with an underline on hover.
- **Inline text links:** Any link within body text or descriptions should be underlined.
- **Don't mislead:** Only apply hover lift/border effects to cards that are actually clickable. Non-clickable cards should still have a subtle hover border but no translateY lift.
- **Link to new tab:** All links should open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) to keep users on the catalog site.

## Hero

- Title: "Foojay **Java in Education** Catalog" (gradient text on "Java in Education")
